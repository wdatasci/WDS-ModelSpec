    CJW - Notes:  At the core of many statistcal models is a linear "score" or the sum of the products of 
        cooefficients and independent variables.  Obviously, this not only includes linear regression models, but
        also logistic (traditional credit score modeling), proportional hazards, and multiple generalized techniques..

        I started using variable information bundles as both a way to both facilitate and instruct model building 
        as well as to communicate the final model back circa 1997-1998 while working at GE Capital Mortgage Corp.

        At first, these communicated in terms of SAS macros.  But, while at First Union/Wachovia, I developed 
        a simple sequential markup pattern, called "variable packets" (very yaml-ish) which worked effectively like:
            
            Name: X
            [Keyword] for [Previously Declared Name]: [Data]

        Keyword information included: Source Variables, Treatments, Critical Values, Use Lists, etc.  This type of
        variable packet file requires other

        In 2005 and 2006, this markup style evolved into XML, starting for basic scoring models and competing risk models.
