# Some LaTeX styles

WDSTechnicalReport.sty - The one used here.  See also ../../../WDS-General/util/llatex, where it is used with lualatex and allows for
gnuplot embedding.

tech[].sty - old styles, some from when CW used to use LaTeX for literate programming.  Doing the reverse of Knuth, embedding the code
inside the TeX.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.
