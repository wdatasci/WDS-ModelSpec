For this WDS Excel AddIn, from Microsoft, the Excel 2013 XLL SDK is used (which is also used in the xll12 files).

This location and the ExcelSDK filter is used for those files which cannot be pointed to and a copy is included as a local source.

Note: For some reason, XLCALL.CPP is "included" in a FRAMEWRK.C, so do not include it as another source.
